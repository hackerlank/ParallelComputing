The parallel KMeans is an example application of the Shared-Space
MapReduce model. The input points comes from either randomly generated
samples or a data file containing the coordinates; both use real
values for the coordinates. A sample point file is also provided in
this release, giving coordinates for five points in a casual format -
one or several points per line, and that you can even separate the
coordinates of a point into consecutive lines. The detailed usage for
the utility is shown as follows:

usage: ./kmeans [options] [point_file]
options:
  -c <cluster>  - number of clusters, the default is 1
  -d <dim>      - dimension, the default is 3
  -g <grid>     - grid size for generating random points, the default is 100.0
  -r <num>      - use random points
  -s <slot>     - MHT slot number, default is NCPU^2
  -t <task>     - number of concurrent tasks, default is NCPU
  -f            - use fixed initial means
  -p            - print point set
  -v            - be verbose
  -h            - show this message

When -r is specified, which tells the utility to generate random
points, no point file should be given. And, one can optionally specify
the grid size of the points through -g. Alternatively, you can also
choose to read the points from a point file, that is, specifying the
point file.

Two methods for choosing the initial clusters are supported in this
version, either be at random or fixed. The random method will select
randomly coordinates for the initial clusters, however, it might
result in fewer clusters upon completion if insufficient points are
given. While the fixed method uses the first C points as initial
clusters, of which C is the number of clusters and thus does not have
this limitation.

Sample Usage

Work with point file:
./kmeans -vpf -c 2 point

Use random points:
./kmeans -v -r 100000 -c 100
