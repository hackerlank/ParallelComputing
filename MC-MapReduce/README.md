###MC-MapReduce - MapReduce over Multicores and Multiprocessors

The goal of MC-MapReduce is to boost the performance of many
computation-intensive application run on multicore machines via
MapReduce.

###Usage Example
A parallel k-means implementation is provided as an example in [MC-Kmeans](https://github.com/ZilongTan/ParallelComputing/tree/master/MC-MapReduce/app/k-means).

###Performance
Performance comparisons are given in [Performance](https://github.com/ZilongTan/ParallelComputing/tree/master/MC-MapReduce/perf).
